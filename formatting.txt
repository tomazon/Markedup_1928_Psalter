within verse text:

  markup rom Saint Dunstan's Plansong Psalter:

    {-}  add a long dash
    {.}  add a dot
    {f}  add a flex
    {v}  add a caron to the next character
    {_}  add a macron to the next character 

    [*]  replace with a "'".  ie.
         "ev[e]ry" becomes "ev'ry" for singing and "every" for matching the 1928 text  PS12:9
         "kindl[e]d"  Ps18:9
